- 👋 Hi, I’m @Joinyy (Johannes)
- 👀 I’m interested in python, photography, music and lately more and more design stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning typescript with react as a frontend for python backend applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate mostly on the tools / libraries that cross my way.
- 📫 How to reach me ... fax? (Joking, but as I live in Germany partly true 📠)

Wow this GitHub template doesn't look too great... #todo
